### Notes for Learning Days
While I said I was going to look into ChartJS this really more like looking into: Vue3/composition API/ChartJS/Random Crypto API's/dayjs

### hiccups
- I had to swtich api's a couple of times
- I decided to use Vue 3 and the composition API it really took me a minute to wrap my head around it
- Once I got my apis working I wasn't 100% sure what data I wanted to graph

### positives
- I got chartjs working and it was crazy easy
- I did end up getting a couple of components workign with the composition api
- I used dayjs instead of moment and it worked with no issues
